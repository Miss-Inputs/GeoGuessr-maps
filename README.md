This has all the JSON files for my GeoGuessr maps, or at least all of them that I remember to put here. Much easier to keep track of, I just feel like the locations shouldn't be a secret, enables me to ramble more than GeoGuessr's description field for maps would allowâ€¦

TODO: Should separate this into source and output (from MapCheckr or what have you (or ideally geoguessr-map-maker))
